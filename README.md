## Currency Transactions App - 10.2019
This app was my recruitment task.

## Usage
To see demo, click <a href='http://kubikweb.usermd.net/currency_transactions/'>here.</a>

## Used technologies
I used React, Redux, Redux-Form, Hooks, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and FontAwesome.

## How it works
1. I defined a currency converter: 1 EURO = x PLN - a user can independently add a value of 1 EURO.
2. I defined a card "Add Transaction", where the user can add a transaction's name and an amount in EURO.
3. After clicking the add button, user can see transaction's list, which contains: a ordinal number, the transaction's name, 
amount in EURO and in PLN (after conversion) and sum of all transactions.
4. Next to the list is displaying an information about the largest transactions (it is sorted by PLN).
5. The user can also remove each transaction from the list.
6. If the user change value of 1 EURO in the currency converter, it is changing values of the earlier transactions.

See you next time!
